BluetoothLEApps
===============

This is a work in progress of my experimentation with Bluetooth LE. Specifically, I'm working with the [TI SensorTag] (http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Bluetooth_SensorTag).

Included is some common BluetoothLE code to make it easier to scan and discover devices and characteristics.

===========
All work here is released under the MIT License. However, if you incorporate this into an app or use it with some Bluetooth LE hardware, I wouldn't mind if you sent me a copy of the software or sent me some hardware. (This isn't mandatory, but I would appreciate it.)
